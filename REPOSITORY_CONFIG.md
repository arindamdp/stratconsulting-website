## üö´ Blocked Email List

### Purpose
Prevent spam submissions from known bad actors and disposable email services.

### Location in Code
File: `index.html`  
Section: `<script>` tag, `blockedEmails` array

### Current Blocked Emails (20 addresses)

```javascript
const blockedEmails = [
    'spam@example.com',
    'unwanted@email.com',
    'zekisuquc419@gmail.com',
    'xrumer888@outlook.com',
    'irinademenkova86@gmail.com',

    'throwaway.email',
    'sharklasers.com',
    'getnada.com',
    'trashmail.com'
];
```

### How to Add New Blocks

**Option 1: Direct Edit (for urgent blocks)**
```bash
# Edit index.html
nano index.html

# Find the blockedEmails array
# Add new email: 'newemail@spam.com',
# Save and commit

git add index.html
git commit -m "Block spam email: newemail@spam.com"
git push
```

**Option 2: Pull Request (recommended)**
```bash
git checkout -b fix/block-spam-email
# Edit index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add spam email to blocklist"
git push -u origin fix/block-spam-email
# Create PR on GitHub
```

### Gmail Filter Configuration

**Backup protection** - Set up Gmail filters to block these emails:

```
From: formsubmit.co
Has the words: xrumer888@outlook.com OR irinademenkova86@gmail.com OR zekisuquc419@gmail.com OR [add all blocked emails with OR]
Action: Delete or Move to Spam
```

See: GITHUB_GUIDE.md section "Gmail Filter Setup" for detailed steps.

## üíæ Backup & Recovery

### Backup Strategy

**Primary Backup:** GitHub repository itself

**Additional Backups:**

1. **Local Clone:**
   - Every team member has full repository copy
   - Location: `~/stratconsulting-website/` (Mac) or `~/Documents/stratconsulting-website/` (Windows)

2. **GoDaddy Hosting:**
   - Live site files on production server
   - Access via FTP or File Manager
   - Independent backup of GitHub

3. **Manual Backups (recommended quarterly):**
   ```bash
   # Create timestamped backup
   cd ~
   zip -r stratconsulting-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).zip stratconsulting-website/
   ```

### Recovery Procedures

**Scenario 1: Deleted Repository**

```bash
# Repository can be restored within 90 days
# Contact GitHub Support: https://support.github.com

# Or recreate from local clone:
cd ~/stratconsulting-website
git remote add origin https://github.com/arindamdp/new-repository-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Scenario 2: Corrupted Files**

```bash
# Revert to last known good state
git log --oneline  # Find good commit
git reset --hard COMMIT_HASH
git push --force
```

**Scenario 3: Accidental Force Push**

```bash
# Find lost commits
git reflog

# Restore from reflog
git reset --hard HEAD@{n}
git push --force
```

**Scenario 4: Need to Restore from GoDaddy**

1. Download files from GoDaddy via FTP/File Manager
2. Compare with local repository
3. Commit any differences
4. Push to GitHub
